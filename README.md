Pipattanasomporn, M.; Feroze, H., Rahman, S. (2009): "Multi-agent systems in a distributed smart grid: Design and implementation," Power Systems Conference and Exposition, 2009. PSCE '09. IEEE/PES , vol. 1 no. 8, pp.15-18

It has been developed with INGENIAS making some changes to the original system. 

Instructions:
-----------
Please, go to http://ingenias.sf.net and install the default software (maven + ant + JDK 1.7) as indicated in the quickstart guide

To execute it: 

- Type in a console "git clone https://github.com/escalope/i2daps.git" or download the zip (and unzip) https://github.com/escalope/i2daps/archive/master.zip
- go to the downloaded folder and open two consoles (let us call them "console1" and "console2")
- In console1 type "ant runjade" and wait for the window to appear. Then,  in console2, type "ant runSimpleMicrogridDeployment"
- In the window titled "node SimpleMicrogridDeployment", go to the "applications" tab
- Look for the "generate" buttons and press them. Check the messages in the console. Alternatively, go to the JADE GUI and use the sniffer to get message traces

To modify this example, you need to know more about INGENIAS. Please, go to http://ingenias.sf.net and learn how it works and what else can give to you.
